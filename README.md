# Global-Content-Delivery-and-Scalable-Application-
Streamlining Global Content Delivery and Scalable Application Architecture with AWS Services


## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable web application architecture using AWS services. The architecture includes global content delivery with Amazon CloudFront, domain routing with Amazon Route 53, and scalable application deployment using Elastic Beanstalk. Additionally, it incorporates data caching, monitoring, and auto-scaling to ensure performance and efficiency.

## Project Structure

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Terraform configuration files for provisioning AWS resources.

2. **Application Code**
   - Node.js or Python application files with the necessary logic and dependencies.

3. **Deployment Files**
   - Docker and Elastic Beanstalk configuration for deployment automation.

4. **Configuration Files**
   - Server and application-specific settings configuration.

5. **Data Storage & Caching**
   - Configuration for data storage (RDS) and caching (ElastiCache).

6. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Setup for logging and monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch.

7. **Diagrams and Screenshots**
   - Visual aids including architecture diagrams and screenshots of AWS configurations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Terraform (for IaC)
- Docker (if using Docker)
- AWS CLI
