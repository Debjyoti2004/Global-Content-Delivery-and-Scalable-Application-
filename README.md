# Global-Content-Delivery-and-Scalable-Application-
Streamlining Global Content Delivery and Scalable Application Architecture with AWS Services


## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable web application architecture using AWS services. The architecture includes global content delivery with Amazon CloudFront, domain routing with Amazon Route 53, and scalable application deployment using Elastic Beanstalk. Additionally, it incorporates data caching, monitoring, and auto-scaling to ensure performance and efficiency.

## Project Structure

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Terraform configuration files for provisioning AWS resources.

2. **Application Code**
   - Node.js or Python application files with the necessary logic and dependencies.

3. **Deployment Files**
   - Docker and Elastic Beanstalk configuration for deployment automation.

4. **Configuration Files**
   - Server and application-specific settings configuration.

5. **Data Storage & Caching**
   - Configuration for data storage (RDS) and caching (ElastiCache).

6. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Setup for logging and monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch.

7. **Diagrams and Screenshots**
   - Visual aids including architecture diagrams and screenshots of AWS configurations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Terraform (for IaC)
- Docker (if using Docker)
- AWS CLI
- Node.js or Python (depending on the application)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
Configure AWS Credentials:
Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the correct credentials.

bash
Copy code
aws configure
Deploy Infrastructure:

Navigate to the Terraform directory and apply the configuration:

bash
Copy code
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
Deploy Application:

Docker-based Deployment:
Ensure Docker is installed and run:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-app .
docker tag your-app:latest your-dockerhub/your-app:latest
Push to Docker Hub:

bash
Copy code
docker push your-dockerhub/your-app:latest
Elastic Beanstalk Deployment:
Use the Elastic Beanstalk CLI to deploy:

bash
Copy code
eb init
eb create
eb deploy
Configure Domain with Route 53:

Set up DNS records in Amazon Route 53 to point to your CloudFront distribution.

Configuration
Nginx Configuration:
Adjust the nginx.conf file to match your server settings and proxy configuration.

Application Configuration:
Modify app.config to set environment-specific variables.

Database Schema:
Apply the db-schema.sql to your RDS instance to set up the initial database schema.

Monitoring
CloudWatch:
Access the AWS CloudWatch console to view logs and metrics. Ensure that cloudwatch-logs-config.json is correctly applied.

Usage
Once deployed, your application will be accessible through the domain configured in Route 53, with global content delivered via CloudFront. The application is designed to scale automatically based on traffic, with performance monitored through CloudWatch.
